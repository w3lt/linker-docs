# 1. Interact with profile of other people

<h4>When interacting with profile of other people, user can:</h4>

- **See profile of a person:** User can see everything on profile of a free user including photos, bio and everything. A premium user can lock a part or full of her/his bio, you have to give her/him a super like to see the hidden part in this case. 
- **Dislike profile of a person:** If user dislike profile of a person, it means that user do not want to see the similar bio. In that case, similar bios will be restricted from displaying to user. User can still search for such bios on search bar.
- **Like profile of a person:** If user like profile of a person, it means that user want to see the similar bio, especially the one he/she just likes. **Linker** will tend to display similar or related bios to user. The owner of liked profile will see who liked her/him. If he/she likes back, then 2 users can connect together. We call it a ***link***.
